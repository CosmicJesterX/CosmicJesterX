# 👋 Greetings, Earthlings – I'm @CosmicJesterX

✨ Full-stack tinkerer, cosmic experimenter, and believer in the beautiful chaos of code and creativity.  
🌌 Raised among fjords, fueled by stars, and never afraid to dive into the unknown.

## 🚀 About Me

- 🔭 Currently building **[insert your favorite project](https://your-project-link.com)** – experimental, magical, maybe even slightly chaotic.
- 🌌 Interests: creative coding, AI art, open-source alchemy, and interstellar UX.
- 🤝 Looking to collaborate on poetic tech, narrative systems, or chaotic good automation.
- 📫 Beam me a message: [your preferred contact or social]
- 😄 Pronouns: [add yours if you'd like!]
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once debugged a script by moonlight while whispering to a microcontroller. It worked. The stars approved.

## 🎧 Vibe With Me

Coding under auroras? This is the frequency I ride:

🎵 **[Almao on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1zYwLtZTlfj7FdS8f4EvVx)**  
Glitchy, meditative, just the right amount of haunted. Loops perfectly between GitHub commits and quantum thoughts.

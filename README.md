## 🚀 About Me

- 🔭 I’m currently building **[insert your current favorite project here](https://your-demo-or-repo-link)** – experimental, magical, maybe even slightly chaotic.
- 🌌 Interests: creative coding, AI art, open-source alchemy, and interstellar UX.
- 🧙‍♂️ Looking to collaborate on playful, poetic, or just plain weird tech.
- 📫 Beam me a message: [your preferred contact or socials]
- 😄 Pronouns: [add if you'd like!]
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once debugged a script by moonlight with incense burning and it *worked*—the stars approved.
